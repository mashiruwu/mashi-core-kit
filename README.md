# MashiCoreKit

**MashiCoreKit** is a Swift package that centralizes shared logic, UI components, and utilities used across my iOS apps.  
It helps keep projects consistent, reduces duplicated code, and makes it easier to evolve design and behavior in a single place.

> Reusable. Opinionated. Built for modern Swift and SwiftUI.
